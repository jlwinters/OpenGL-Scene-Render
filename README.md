My approach to designing software typically changes based on the specific project that I'm working on, so for the sake of simplicity, I am going to explain my approach while working on my final OpenGL project. The project began with me choosing a scene to replicate in a 3D environment, so I chose a typical office space. From here, I broke down the environment to the basic shapes involved, and then devised a plan to recreate these objects using C++ and OpenGL libraries. When developing programs, I try to put significant effort towards ensuring that the user experience is pleasant, and that everything works as expected. In addition to this, I provide in-depth comments within my code, and maintain professional programming structure. 


Computer science helps me reach my goals in several ways. I have a passion for all things relating to technology, and working in the computer science field allows for me to stay aware of new trends. My goals consist of being the best software engineer that I can be, and to solve the problems that others can't figure out. I believe that my personality traits of being a problem solver and always wanting to learn, both contribute to my future success in the computer science field. Computational graphics and visualizations give me important skills that can be useful in both, my future educational, and professional pathway. As C++ is a particularly common programming language, the knowledge that I gained throughout this course will prove especially useful during the rest of my learning journey. I have learned a lot about C++ and OpenGL libraries, and how I can use this knowledge to create fully realized concepts for professional applications.
